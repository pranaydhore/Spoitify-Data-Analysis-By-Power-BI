## ðŸ–© DAX Formulas Used
# DAX
Total Streams = SUM(SpotifyData[Streams])

Top Artist = CALCULATE(MAX(SpotifyData[Artist]), 
    FILTER(SpotifyData, SpotifyData[Streams] = MAX(SpotifyData[Streams])))

Top Genre = CALCULATE(MAX(SpotifyData[Genre]), 
    FILTER(SpotifyData, SpotifyData[Streams] = MAX(SpotifyData[Streams])))

Average Streams per Artist = AVERAGEX(VALUES(SpotifyData[Artist]), 
    SUM(SpotifyData[Streams]))

Top Song by Popularity = CALCULATE(MAX(SpotifyData[Song]), 
    FILTER(SpotifyData, SpotifyData[Popularity] = MAX(SpotifyData[Popularity])))

Monthly Growth Rate = (SUM(SpotifyData[Streams]) - 
    CALCULATE(SUM(SpotifyData[Streams]), PREVIOUSMONTH(SpotifyData[Date]))) / 
    CALCULATE(SUM(SpotifyData[Streams]), PREVIOUSMONTH(SpotifyData[Date]))
